# DevOps Foundations 

Welcome to my DevOps learning journey! This repository serves as a public showcase of my transition from a **Backend Developer** to a **Full Stack Developer** who understands the power of automation and CI/CD.

##  What's inside?
- **GitHub Actions Workflows:** My very first `.yml` pipeline configurations.
- **CI/CD Experiments:** Automating builds, testing, and environment checks.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Exploring how to define environments through configuration files.

##  Learning Goals
As a BSIT student specializing in Backend Development, I am using this repo to:
1. Master **GitHub Actions** for automated testing.
2. Understand **Docker** containerization (Coming soon!).
3. Bridge the gap between code and deployment.
